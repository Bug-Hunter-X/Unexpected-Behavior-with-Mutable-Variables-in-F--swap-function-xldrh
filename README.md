This example demonstrates an unexpected behavior when working with mutable variables and functions in F#.  The `swap` function attempts to swap two mutable integers, but due to pass-by-reference semantics and the function's local scope, the swap doesn't affect the original variables. The solution showcases a correct approach using tuples or a helper function to achieve the desired swap functionality.
